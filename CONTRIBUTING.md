# Contributing to Speakez

Thanks for your interest in contributing! 🎙️

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/speakez.git`
3. Run `./setup.sh` to fetch whisper.cpp and build dependencies
4. Open `Speakez.xcodeproj` (generated by XcodeGen) in Xcode

## Development Setup

**Requirements:**
- macOS 13.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`)

**Build steps:**
```bash
./setup.sh          # Fetch and build whisper.cpp
xcodegen generate   # Generate Xcode project
open Speakez.xcodeproj
```

## Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Test thoroughly (including on Intel Macs if possible)
4. Commit with clear messages
5. Push and open a PR

## Guidelines

- **Keep it simple** — this is a minimal, focused app
- **Privacy first** — no telemetry, no network calls (except model downloads)
- **Test on Intel** — many users don't have Apple Silicon
- **Document your changes** — update README if needed

## Code Style

- Follow existing Swift conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Keep services decoupled

## Reporting Issues

Please include:
- macOS version
- Mac model (Intel/Apple Silicon)
- Steps to reproduce
- Console logs if relevant (`Console.app` → filter by "Speakez")
